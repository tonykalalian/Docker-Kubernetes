# Scalable RESTful API with Kubernetes, Node.js, and MySQL

This project is a highly scalable RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data from a MySQL database. The API is containerized and deployed using Kubernetes, with NGINX as the ingress controller to expose it to the internet. It also includes features like horizontal pod autoscaling, monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, SSL/TLS security with Let's Encrypt (if enabled), Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data, input validation, pagination, sorting, filtering, and unit tests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the API on your Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and services installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) (for local development, optional)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (for managing Kubernetes charts, optional)
- [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) (for exposing the API)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. cd to directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```
4. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t your-image-name .
   ```
6. Deploy the application to Kubernetes (using Helm or kubectl):
   ##### Using Helm
    ```
    helm install your-release-name ./charts/your-chart
    ```

   ##### OR using kubectl:
   ```
     kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is deployed, you can access it using the following endpoint: https://your-api-url.

## Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

- GET /api/books:  Retrieve a list of books with optional pagination, sorting, and filtering.
- GET /api/books/:id : Retrieve a book by ID.
- POST /api/books:  Create a new book.
- PUT /api/books/:id : Update an existing book.
- DELETE /api/books/:id : Delete a book by ID.
## Scaling
The API is set up for horizontal pod autoscaling based on traffic. Kubernetes will automatically scale the number of instances up or down to handle the load.

## Monitoring
- Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring the performance and health of the API.
- Access Prometheus dashboard at http://prometheus-url.
- Access Grafana dashboard at http://grafana-url.
## Security
- SSL/TLS security is enabled using Let's Encrypt (if applicable).
- Sensitive data such as passwords and API keys are securely stored in Kubernetes secrets.
## Testing
Unit tests are provided for all endpoints. To run the tests:
```
npm test
```
## Best Practices
Follow best coding practices to ensure code maintainability and scalability.
